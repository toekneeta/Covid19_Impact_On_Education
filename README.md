This is a copy of my final project for COGS 108.

This project explores issues that relate to students’ experiences with remote learning during the pandemic. We will first visualize the relationships between our variables of interest that are stated in the research question, then we will run statistical tests to analyze the dependency of those relationships. This project will determine how each of the variables analyzed have an effect, if at all, on students’ mental health.
